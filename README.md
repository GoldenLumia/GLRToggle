walter white: wow!

Needs NET 6.0. Uses global filepaths. So if you're Steam isn't installed on C: and User32.dll isn't in your root Steam folder, this isn't going to work.

This program will create a "disabled" directory in your root Steam folder, and then move the dll from your root to your disabled folder as you click the button.

Enjoy(?)
